## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Build a Deep learning or Machine learning based solution to generate image using text description.
Data Gathering: 
We would encourage you to use any online dataset to complete your task
Hint: Collect data using online resources if you want to try with other dataset.

### Project Requirements: 
1. Git and Github are mandatory for your project.
2. Dockerize your entire training pipeline and deploy it on any cloud using GitHub action. Ex-: Free cloud-like -: Vercel, and also the Netlify, Heroku, Railway App
3. Expose your model as an API for prediction
4. API must be deployed using docker containers.
5. All artifacts from the training pipeline should be versioned and stored/archived in any cloud or remote storage.
6. Implementation of MLOPS practices.

### What to Submit 
1. Provide a URL to your working prototype.  
2. Provide a URL to your GitHub code repository. The repository must be public and have an open-source license from one of the following:  
MIT - The MIT License | Open Source Initiative   
Apache 2.0 - Apache-2.0 | licenses
3-Clause BSD - The 3-Clause BSD License | Open Source Initiative  
Include a video (3-5 minutes) that demonstrates your project in action (hosted on YouTube, LinkedIn, or Facebook Video and made public). The video must include an explanation along with future enhancement for your product.


## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

We are building image-to-text named Imagine.


## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```
